# 0-10v PWM LED Dimming Controller (includes Home Assistant Integration)

This repository provides the code and instructions to build a custom LED dimming controller using 0-10v pulse-width modulation (PWM) technology including the code and setup to integrate with Home Assistant. The controller allows for precise adjustment of LED light brightness and is a cost-effective and personalized solution compared to commercially available dimming options.  Includes stl for 3D printed case.

## Parts Needed
- [Adafruit TLC5947 **24-Channel** 12-bit PWM LED Driver](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1429)
or [Adafruit TLC59711 **12-Channel** 16-bit PWM LED Driver](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3995)  
These boards generate PWM signals at whatever voltage you feed to it (up to 30v) In our project we will be connecting a 10v power supply to a 24-channel board to generate 24 0-10v pwm signals!
